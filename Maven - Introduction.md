A)Maven - Introduction & Importance
What is Maven?

Maven is a project management tool used in Java development.

It helps in compiling, running, testing, packaging, and deploying a project.

Why do we need Maven?

A Java project often requires external libraries (JAR files).

Example: To connect Java with a database, we need a database connector JAR (MySQL Connector, Postgres Connector, etc.).

If using frameworks like Hibernate or Spring, multiple JAR files are required, including transitive dependencies (dependencies of dependencies).

Problems without Maven:

Manually searching and downloading JAR files is time-consuming.

Keeping version compatibility between dependencies (e.g., Hibernate & Spring) is challenging.

Sharing projects with teammates requires them to download the same dependencies manually.

How Maven Helps:

Manages dependencies automatically.

Ensures version compatibility between different libraries.

Provides plugins for compiling, testing, running, and deploying.

Other Tools:

Alternatives: Gradle, Ivy, etc.

Maven is beginner-friendly and widely used in Java development.

How Maven Works:

Developers specify dependencies in Maven.

Example: "Maven, I need Hibernate dependency (specific version)."

Maven fetches and manages dependencies automatically.

Focus of This Section:

Understanding Maven for dependency management (not plugins).

Maven simplifies working with frameworks like Spring and Hibernate.




B)Setting Up Maven


Ways to Use Maven:

Install Locally: Download from Maven's official website, set up the path, and use it via the command line.

Use with IDE (Preferred): Most IDEs like IntelliJ IDEA and Eclipse support Maven by default.

Creating a Maven Project in IntelliJ IDEA:

Open IntelliJ IDEA → Click on New Project.

Choose Java as the language.

Select Maven as the build system to maintain a consistent project structure across different IDEs.

Click Create, and IntelliJ will set up the Maven project automatically.

Maven Lifecycle (Automation of Project Stages):

Found under the Maven tool window in IDEs.

Key lifecycle phases:

Compile: Compiles all source files.

Test: Runs test cases.

Package: Creates a JAR file.

Install: Installs the project to the local repository.

Deploy: Deploys the project (requires configuration).

Maven Plugins:

Plugins automate tasks like compiling, packaging, testing, and deployment.

Accessible through IDEs or command-line execution.

Maven Basics and Archetypes
Maven Archetypes (Project Templates)
Maven provides a feature called Archetypes, which act as project templates. Instead of manually setting up configurations, developers can use pre-built templates to streamline project creation.

Why Use Archetypes?
Automates project setup.

Reduces manual configuration effort.

Ensures consistency in multiple projects within an organization.

Allows the creation of custom archetypes for reusable templates.

Maven Dependency Management
Understanding Dependencies in Maven
A dependency refers to an external library (JAR file) required for a project.

Maven simplifies dependency management by automatically fetching required JAR files.

Instead of manually downloading JAR files, dependencies can be declared in the pom.xml file.

Fetching Dependencies Manually (Traditional Way)
Search for a library (e.g., MySQL Connector) on Google.

Download the JAR file from the official site.

Manually add it to the project.

Manage versions and updates manually.

Fetching Dependencies Using Maven
Go to mvnrepository.com.

Search for the required library (e.g., MySQL Connector).

Copy the Maven dependency XML snippet.

Paste it into the pom.xml file inside the <dependencies> tag.

Reload Maven (via Maven Tool Window in IntelliJ IDEA).

Maven downloads the required JAR files automatically.

Structure of a Maven Dependency (GAV)
Each dependency follows a GAV structure:

Group ID: Identifies the organization or project (e.g., com.mysql).

Artifact ID: Name of the specific library (e.g., mysql-connector-j).

Version: Defines the version of the library (e.g., 8.0.26).

Example: MySQL Connector Dependency
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.mysql</groupId>
    <artifactId>mysql-connector-j</artifactId>
    <version>8.0.26</version>
</dependency>
Maven Transitive Dependencies
Some dependencies require other libraries to function.

Maven automatically downloads and manages these transitive dependencies.

Example: Adding Hibernate as a dependency will also download its required libraries (e.g., GlassFish, JDBC drivers, etc.).

Adding Hibernate Dependency
Search for hibernate-core in mvnrepository.com.

Copy the dependency XML.

Paste it inside <dependencies> in pom.xml.

Reload Maven to download all required files.

Example: Hibernate Dependency
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.hibernate</groupId>
    <artifactId>hibernate-core</artifactId>
    <version>5.4.32.Final</version>
</dependency>
Maven Project Object Model (POM.XML)
The pom.xml file is the heart of a Maven project.

Defines:

Project metadata (name, version, etc.).

Dependencies.

Plugins.

Build configurations.

Key Elements in pom.xml
<project>
    <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>
    <groupId>com.example</groupId>
    <artifactId>my-maven-project</artifactId>
    <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>

    <dependencies>
        <!-- Place all dependencies here -->
    </dependencies>
</project>
Sharing Maven Projects
No need to share JAR files.

Simply share the pom.xml file.

The receiver can reload Maven and automatically fetch all dependencies.

Summary of Maven Concepts (From Transcript Only)
Maven Archetypes

A templating tool for creating predefined project structures.

Useful for setting up multiple projects with the same configuration.

Dependency Management

Dependencies (JAR files) are managed via pom.xml.

Uses GAV (Group ID, Artifact ID, Version) for unique identification.

Dependencies can have transitive dependencies (other required JARs).

Example: MySQL Connector, Hibernate dependencies are added and auto-downloaded.

POM (Project Object Model) File

pom.xml defines project metadata, dependencies, and configurations.

Dependency stack allows multiple dependencies.

Can also include plugins for additional functionality.

Effective POM (Super POM)

The actual POM used by Maven, including default settings.

Contains built-in dependencies and plugins even if not explicitly added.

Can be viewed in IntelliJ via Right Click → Maven → Show Effective POM.

Developers modify only pom.xml, while Maven generates the effective POM.

Maven Plugins

Provide functionalities like compiling, cleaning, and packaging.

Many default plugins are included in the effective POM.

Project Sharing in Maven

Instead of sharing JARs, share the pom.xml file.

Other developers can reload Maven to fetch all dependencies.

Summary of Maven Archetypes (From Transcript)
What Are Archetypes?

Templates used to generate project structures.

Predefined configurations reduce manual setup effort.

Developers can use existing archetypes or create their own.

Using Maven Archetypes in IntelliJ

When creating a new project, select "Maven Archetypes."

Choose from available archetypes like:

quickstart (basic setup)

webapp (for web applications)

j2ee-simple (for J2EE projects)

Internal catalog provides default options.

Fetching Archetypes from Maven Central

External archetypes can be loaded from Maven Central Repository.

More options are available online, including Spring Boot templates.

Spring Boot Project Using Archetypes

Selecting a Spring Boot archetype auto-configures the project.

Downloads required dependencies like:

spring-boot-starter, webmvc, jersey, jdbc, H2.

Generates project structure with:

Predefined configuration files.

Test files.

application.properties for environment settings.

Archetypes in Eclipse

Eclipse also supports archetypes.

Offers selection during project creation, unlike IntelliJ's multi-step process.

Key Benefit: Archetypes provide a ready-to-use project structure, saving time on configuration.

Summary: Using Maven in Eclipse
Creating a Maven Project in Eclipse

Open Eclipse IDE → Go to File > New > Maven Project.

Ensure the Java EE perspective is selected (for enterprise projects).

Uncheck the "Create a simple project" option to allow archetype selection.

Selecting Archetypes in Eclipse

Eclipse retrieves available archetypes.

Choose an archetype (e.g., mvc-archetype).

Define Group ID and Artifact ID (e.g., com.telusko, DemoMVCProject).

Click Finish to generate the project structure.

Generated Project Structure

Eclipse provides a predefined folder structure.

Default Spring MVC controller code is included.

The POM.xml file is generated, where dependencies can be added.

Viewing the Effective POM

Eclipse allows viewing the effective POM, similar to IntelliJ.

It displays the project's dependencies, including transitive dependencies.

Key Takeaway

Maven's functionality remains the same across IDEs (IntelliJ or Eclipse).

The effective POM, dependencies, and project structure are consistent.

Summary: How Maven Works Behind the Scenes
Dependency Resolution Process

When you add dependencies in pom.xml, Maven searches for them in your local machine first.

If the dependency is already available in the local .m2/repository folder, Maven uses it.

If not found, Maven fetches it from Maven Central Repository (or a remote repository).

Local Repository (.m2 Folder)

Located in the user directory (~/.m2/repository on Mac/Linux, C:\Users\username\.m2\repository on Windows).

Stores previously downloaded dependencies to avoid redundant downloads.

If dependencies are deleted from .m2, Maven will re-download them when needed.

Remote Repository (Maven Central & Others)

Maven Central is the default remote repository where dependencies are downloaded from.

Additional repositories can be configured in pom.xml if required.

Security & Vulnerable Dependencies

Some libraries may have security vulnerabilities.

IDEs (like IntelliJ) warn about unsafe versions.

Developers should update to the latest stable versions from the Maven repository.

Company-Wide Repository (Private Repository)

Large organizations don’t allow direct access to Maven Central for security reasons.

Instead, they maintain an internal company repository (e.g., Nexus, Artifactory).

If a dependency isn’t available, developers request approval to fetch it from Maven Central.

Fixing Issues with Dependencies

If a dependency doesn't work correctly, try deleting it from the .m2/repository folder and re-downloading it.

Updating dependency versions can fix compatibility issues.

Key Takeaway
Maven efficiently manages dependencies by checking local storage first, then fetching from remote repositories. For security, organizations use internal repositories to ensure only verified dependencies are used.
