### **Introduction to Spring Framework**

#### **1. What is Spring Framework?**
- Spring is a **Java-based framework** for building **enterprise-level applications**.
- It provides a comprehensive programming model and **integrates multiple functionalities** (such as ORM, AOP, Security, and more).
- Spring is **lightweight**, meaning it works efficiently with **POJOs (Plain Old Java Objects)** without requiring heavyweight configurations.

#### **2. Why Use Spring?**
- Before Spring, developers used different frameworks like:
  - **EJB (Enterprise Java Beans)** for business logic.
  - **Struts** for web applications.
  - **Hibernate** for database interactions.
- Spring **combines and simplifies** these functionalities, providing a **unified ecosystem**.

#### **3. Spring as an Ecosystem**
- Spring is not just one framework; it consists of multiple **projects** designed for different use cases.
- Some of the most important projects include:
  - **Spring Framework** (Core framework)
  - **Spring Boot** (Simplifies development)
  - **Spring Data** (Database integration)
  - **Spring Security** (Authentication & authorization)
  - **Spring Cloud** (Microservices support)
  - **Spring Batch** (Batch processing)
  - **Spring for GraphQL** (GraphQL API support)

#### **4. Springâ€™s Key Capabilities**
- With Spring, you can build:
  - **Microservices**
  - **Reactive applications**
  - **Cloud applications**
  - **Web applications**
  - **Serverless applications**
  - **Batch and event-driven applications**

#### **5. Spring vs. Spring Boot**
- **Spring Framework** is the **core** framework that provides dependency injection and modular components.
- **Spring Boot** is a **layer on top** of Spring that **simplifies configuration** and development.
- Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone applications with minimal setup.

#### **6. Roadmap for This Course**
- **Step 1**: Learn the **Spring Framework** (Core Concepts).
- **Step 2**: Move to **Spring Boot** to simplify development.
- **Step 3**: Explore additional modules:
  - Spring ORM (Database handling)
  - Spring AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming)
  - Spring Security (Authentication & Authorization)
  - Microservices with Spring Boot

This journey will help us understand why Spring is widely used in **modern enterprise applications**.

B)
### **Why is Spring So Popular?**

Spring is one of the most widely used Java frameworks. But what makes it so popular?

#### **1. Key Factors Behind Springâ€™s Popularity**
Several aspects contribute to the success of any framework, including:

- **Features**: A framework must offer useful features that simplify development.
- **Community Support**: A strong and active community ensures continuous improvements, troubleshooting, and knowledge sharing.
- **Documentation**: Well-structured documentation helps developers understand and implement the framework effectively.

Spring excels in all three areas:
âœ” **Rich features** for enterprise application development.  
âœ” **Large community** with extensive support forums and open-source contributions.  
âœ” **Comprehensive documentation** to guide developers at every step.

#### **2. Spring's Official Documentation**
- Spring provides **detailed documentation** that is constantly updated.
- To access it:
  1. Search **"Spring Docs"** on Google.
  2. Click on the first official link.
  3. Check the documentation for the latest version (e.g., 6.1.1, 6.1.2).
  4. Browse topics like **AOP, Dependency Injection, Microservices, etc.**

If you enjoy reading, Spring's official documentation is a **great learning resource** alongside this course.

C)
### **Prerequisites for Learning Spring Framework**  

Before diving into Spring, it's essential to have a strong foundation in **core Java** and related technologies. Hereâ€™s what you need to know:  

#### **1. Core Java** (Mandatory)  
You must be comfortable with:  
- **Java Syntax**: Basic programming concepts in Java.  
- **OOP Concepts**: Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction.  
- **Exception Handling**: Try-catch blocks, throws, and custom exceptions.  
- **Collections Framework**: Lists, Sets, Maps, and their implementations.  
- **Threads (Basic Understanding)**: Though not crucial, understanding basic multithreading concepts will help.  

#### **2. JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)**  
Since most enterprise applications involve databases, you should know how Java connects to a database using **JDBC**. This includes:  
- Writing SQL queries in Java.  
- Using `Connection`, `Statement`, and `ResultSet`.  
- Performing CRUD operations.  

#### **3. Build Tools (Maven or Gradle)**  
Spring projects rely on build tools to manage dependencies and automate tasks. This course will use **Maven**, so basic knowledge of:  
- `pom.xml`  
- Adding dependencies  
- Running a Maven project  

#### **4. ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) & Hibernate**  
Spring ORM integrates with Hibernate, so understanding **Hibernate basics** is useful:  
- Entity classes and annotations (`@Entity`, `@Table`, `@Column`).  
- CRUD operations with Hibernate.  
- SessionFactory and Transactions.  

#### **5. Servlets (Basic Understanding)**  
While modern web applications use **Spring MVC**, knowing Servlets helps because:  
- Spring MVC runs on a **Servlet container** (like Tomcat).  
- Springâ€™s request-handling mechanism is built over **Servlets**.  
- If you know how Servlets process requests, youâ€™ll understand **DispatcherServlet** in Spring MVC more easily.  

ðŸ’¡ *Even if you don't know Servlets, a brief introduction will be provided in the course.*  

---

### **Final Thought**  
If you're confident in **Core Java, JDBC, Maven, Hibernate, and basic Servlets**, you're ready to start with **Spring Framework**! ðŸš€

D)
### **Software Requirements for Running a Spring Application**  

Before starting with Spring, you need to set up some essential tools. Hereâ€™s what youâ€™ll need:  

---

### **1. Java Development Kit (JDK)**  
Since Spring 6 requires **Java 17 or above**, ensure you have JDK installed.  
- Check your installed Java version:  
  ```sh
  java -version
  ```
- If you donâ€™t have it, download it from the [Oracle JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) or use OpenJDK.  

---

### **2. Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**  
You can choose from multiple IDEs:  
âœ… **Eclipse** (With Spring Tool Suite Plugin)  
âœ… **IntelliJ IDEA** (Ultimate has built-in Spring support, Community doesn't)  
âœ… **VS Code** (With Spring Extensions)  

**Preferred IDE:**  
- **Eclipse** (with Spring Tool 4 plugin) provides **direct Spring support**.  
- **IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition** doesnâ€™t support Spring natively, but you can still work with Maven projects.  
- **VS Code** has **Spring Extensions** that can be installed separately.  

---

### **3. Setting Up Spring in Eclipse**  
1. Download **Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers** from [Eclipse Downloads](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/).  
2. Open Eclipse â†’ Go to **Help** â†’ Select **Eclipse Marketplace**.  
3. Search for **Spring Tools 4** and install it.  
4. Restart Eclipse.  

Now, Eclipse is ready for Spring development.  

---

### **4. Setting Up Spring in VS Code**  
1. Open VS Code â†’ Go to **Extensions Marketplace**.  
2. Search and install:  
   - **Spring Boot Extension Pack (by VMware)**  
   - **Spring Initializr**  
3. Now, you can create and manage Spring Boot projects inside VS Code.  

---

### **5. IntelliJ IDEA for Spring**  
- **IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate** has built-in Spring support.  
- **IntelliJ IDEA Community** doesnâ€™t have Spring support, but you can still create a Spring Boot project manually using **Maven**.  

If using the Community version, you might prefer Eclipse due to its **native Spring support**.  

---

### **Final Choice: Which IDE to Use?**  
ðŸ’¡ **If using the free version of IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse is a better choice since it has built-in Spring support.**  

Next, weâ€™ll see how to create a **Spring Project** using Maven. ðŸš€

E)
### **Understanding IoC (Inversion of Control) & DI (Dependency Injection)**  

Before diving into Spring, itâ€™s crucial to understand **IoC (Inversion of Control)** and **DI (Dependency Injection)**â€”two key principles that Spring is built on.  

---

### **1. What is IoC (Inversion of Control)?**  
**Definition:** IoC is a principle where **you transfer control of object creation and management to a container (Spring IoC Container)** instead of manually handling it in your code.  

#### **Why do we need IoC?**  
Traditionally, in Java, we create objects like this:  
```java
Laptop obj = new Laptop();
```  
Here, we manually create and manage objects using the `new` keyword.  

ðŸš¨ **Problem:**  
- You are responsible for object creation, maintenance, and destruction.  
- This increases complexity, making it harder to manage dependencies.  

ðŸ’¡ **Solution:**  
- Instead of manually creating objects, **let Spring handle object creation.**  
- Spring uses an **IoC container** to manage object lifecycles.  

ðŸ”¹ **IoC Container**: A Spring-managed container that stores objects (beans) and provides them when needed.  

---

### **2. What is Dependency Injection (DI)?**  
**Definition:** DI is a design pattern that allows the Spring container to **inject required dependencies into objects automatically**.  

#### **Example of Dependency Injection**  
Imagine a **Laptop** class that depends on a **CPU** class:  
```java
class Laptop {
    CPU cpu = new CPU();  // Tight coupling
}
```  
ðŸš¨ **Problem:**  
- `Laptop` is directly creating an instance of `CPU`, making the code **tightly coupled**.  
- If we need to change the CPU type (Intel, AMD), we must modify the `Laptop` class.  

ðŸ’¡ **Solution: Use Dependency Injection**  
Instead of creating the CPU object inside `Laptop`, let Spring inject it:  
```java
class Laptop {
    private CPU cpu;
    
    // Injecting dependency through constructor
    public Laptop(CPU cpu) {  
        this.cpu = cpu;
    }
}
```  
Now, Spring will **provide (inject) the CPU object** when needed, reducing tight coupling.  

---

### **3. Relationship Between IoC & DI**  
ðŸ”¹ **IoC is the principle** (Spring manages object creation).  
ðŸ”¹ **DI is the design pattern** (Spring injects dependencies automatically).  
ðŸ”¹ **Spring IoC Container implements DI** to inject required objects.  

ðŸ“Œ **In short:** IoC inverts control of object creation, and DI is the technique to achieve this.  

---

### **Next Steps**  
In upcoming lessons, weâ€™ll see **how Spring implements DI using annotations and XML configuration.** ðŸš€

F)
### **Spring vs. Spring Boot & Implementing Dependency Injection**  

Before implementing **Dependency Injection (DI)** in Spring, we need to understand the difference between **Spring** and **Spring Boot** and why Spring Boot exists.  

---

## **1. Spring vs. Spring Boot**  

| Feature         | Spring Framework | Spring Boot |
|---------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Definition** | A core framework for building Java applications using Dependency Injection. | A layer on top of Spring that simplifies setup and reduces configuration effort. |
| **Configuration** | Requires manual configuration (XML, Java-based) for dependencies, beans, and web settings. | Comes with auto-configuration, so minimal setup is required. |
| **Project Setup** | Tedious (create a project, configure XML/annotations, define beans, etc.). | Fast (Spring Boot provides a ready-to-run project). |
| **Opinionated** | No predefined settings; you must configure everything. | Opinionated (follows best practices by default). |
| **Execution** | Requires a separate Tomcat/Jetty server to run web applications. | Embedded Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertowâ€”no need to deploy separately. |

ðŸ’¡ **Key Takeaway:**  
- **Spring is the foundation** (framework) that provides DI, IoC, and other features.  
- **Spring Boot simplifies Spring** by removing boilerplate code and configurations.  

---

## **2. Why Spring Boot?**  

Initially, Spring required **a lot of configurations**, even for simple applications. Example:
- Configuring XML files for dependency injection.  
- Manually setting up beans.  
- Setting up a web server separately.  

With **Spring Boot**, everything is **pre-configured**:
- It provides **default settings** and an opinionated project structure.  
- You can create a **Spring Boot application** and run it directly **without much setup**.  

ðŸ“Œ **Spring Boot makes Spring development faster and easier.**  

---

## **3. How Spring Boot Works with Spring**  

Even though we use **Spring Boot**, behind the scenes, we are still using **Spring Framework**.  

- **Spring Boot is just an extension of Spring** that automates configurations.  
- It **internally uses Spring features** like Dependency Injection, IoC, etc.  

ðŸ‘‰ **Spring Boot â‰  Replacement for Spring**  
Spring Boot **uses** Spring. It just makes it easier to work with.

---

## **4. Implementing Dependency Injection in Spring Boot**  

We will first implement **DI in Spring Boot**, and later, weâ€™ll see how it works **behind the scenes** with the Spring Framework.

### **Next Steps**  
ðŸ”¹ **Create a simple Spring Boot project**  
ðŸ”¹ **Use DI to inject dependencies**  
ðŸ”¹ **Understand how Spring Boot handles DI internally**  

Letâ€™s get started with coding in the upcoming lessons! ðŸš€

### **Creating Your First Spring Boot Application**  

Now, letâ€™s create our first **Spring Boot application** step by step.

---

## **1. Setting Up Spring Boot Project in Eclipse**  

1. **Open Eclipse** and go to **File â†’ New â†’ Spring Starter Project**.  
2. It will ask for project details:  
   - **Project Name**: `SpringBootFirstApp`  
   - **Build Tool**: `Maven`  
   - **Packaging**: `Jar`  
   - **Java Version**: `17`  
   - **Group ID**: `com.telusko`  
   - **Artifact ID**: `SpringBootFirstApp`  
   - **Package Name**: `com.telusko.app`  
3. Click **Next** (Don't add dependencies for now).  
4. Click **Finish**, and your Spring Boot project is created.  

---

## **2. Creating Spring Boot Project Using start.spring.io** (Alternative Method)  

If you are using **IntelliJ IDEA (Community Version)**, you wonâ€™t find the Spring Boot option.  
Instead, follow these steps:

1. Open your browser and go to **[start.spring.io](https://start.spring.io/)**.  
2. Fill in the details:  
   - **Project**: Maven  
   - **Language**: Java  
   - **Spring Boot Version**: 3.2  
   - **Group**: `com.telusko`  
   - **Artifact**: `SpringBootDemo`  
   - **Package Name**: `com.telusko.app`  
   - **Java Version**: `17`  
3. Click **Generate**, and it will download a **ZIP file**.  
4. Extract the ZIP file and open it in **IntelliJ IDEA (Community Edition)** using **File â†’ Open**.  

---

## **3. Exploring the Spring Boot Project Structure**  

Once the project is open, youâ€™ll see:
- **src/main/java** â†’ Where your Java code is written.  
- **src/main/resources** â†’ Contains `application.properties`.  
- **pom.xml** â†’ Manages dependencies.  

### **Checking the `pom.xml`**
Open `pom.xml` and youâ€™ll see:
```xml
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```
This is the only dependency required for a basic **Spring Boot** application.

---

## **4. Running Your First Spring Boot App**  

### **Locate the `SpringBootFirstAppApplication.java` file**  
This file is automatically generated inside `com.telusko.app`.  

#### **Modify `SpringBootFirstAppApplication.java` to print "Hello, World!"**
```java
package com.telusko.app;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;

@SpringBootApplication
public class SpringBootFirstAppApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(SpringBootFirstAppApplication.class, args);
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```
### **Run the Application**
1. Right-click on the `SpringBootFirstAppApplication.java` file.  
2. Select **Run as â†’ Java Application**.  
3. Youâ€™ll see Spring Boot logs in the console, and at the end, `"Hello, World!"` will be printed.  

---

## **5. Understanding Spring Boot Startup Logs**  

When you run the application, Spring Boot prints:
```
  .   ____          _            __ _ _
 /\\ / ___'_ __ _ _(_)_ __  __ _ \ \ \ \
( ( )\___ | '_ | '_| | '_ \/ _` | \ \ \ \
 \\/  ___)| |_)| | | | | || (_| |  ) ) ) )
  '  |____| .__|_| |_|_| |_\__, | / / / /
 =========|_|==============|___/=/_/_/_/
 :: Spring Boot ::  (v3.2)

Hello, World!
```
This shows:
- Spring Boot **started successfully**.
- **Spring Framework is internally being used (Version 6).**
- Our **"Hello, World!"** message is printed.  

---

### **Next Steps**  
Now that we have a **Spring Boot application running**, let's move on to **Dependency Injection (DI)** in the next lesson. ðŸš€

H)
Hereâ€™s a structured and simplified note based on the video transcript:  

---

# **Dependency Injection in Spring**  

### **Why Use Dependency Injection?**  
- In traditional Java, we manually create objects using `new`.  
- In Spring, the framework manages object creation using a **container**.  
- Objects managed by Spring are called **beans**.  

### **Setting Up a Spring Bean**  
1. **Create a Simple Class**  
   ```java
   package com.telusko.app;  

   import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

   @Component // Marks this class as a Spring-managed bean
   public class Alien {
       public void code() {
           System.out.println("Coding");
       }
   }
   ```
   - `@Component` tells Spring to manage the **Alien** object.  
   - Without this annotation, Spring will not create the object automatically.  

2. **Modify Main Application**  
   ```java
   package com.telusko.app;  

   import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
   import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
   import org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext;

   @SpringBootApplication
   public class App {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           ApplicationContext context = SpringApplication.run(App.class, args);

           Alien obj = context.getBean(Alien.class);
           obj.code();
       }
   }
   ```
   - `SpringApplication.run(App.class, args)` initializes the **Spring Container**.  
   - `context.getBean(Alien.class)` retrieves the `Alien` object managed by Spring.  

3. **Verifying Dependency Injection**  
   - Running the application prints:  
     ```
     Coding
     ```
   - This confirms that Spring created the object instead of manually using `new Alien()`.  

### **Creating Multiple Bean Instances**
   ```java
   Alien obj1 = context.getBean(Alien.class);
   Alien obj2 = context.getBean(Alien.class);

   obj1.code();
   obj2.code();
   ```
   - Output:
     ```
     Coding
     Coding
     ```
   - Are both objects the same or different?  
   - The answer depends on **Spring Bean Scope**, which we will explore later.  

### **Next Steps**
- What if an **Alien** object depends on another object?  
- Understanding **Dependency Injection with Multiple Beans**.

I)
# **Dependency Injection in Spring Boot**

## **Understanding Multi-Level Dependency Injection**
### **Problem Statement**
- The `Alien` class depends on a `Laptop` to perform compilation.
- Instead of manually creating a `Laptop` object, we let Spring manage it.
- The main method gets the `Alien` object from the Spring container, but `Alien` itself needs a `Laptop` object.
- We use **Dependency Injection (DI)** to manage this dependency.

---

## **Step 1: Create the `Laptop` Class**
```java
package com.telusko.app;

import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component // Marks this class as a Spring-managed bean
public class Laptop {
    public void compile() {
        System.out.println("Compiling");
    }
}
```
- `@Component` registers `Laptop` as a Spring bean.
- It has a simple `compile()` method that prints "Compiling".

---

## **Step 2: Modify the `Alien` Class**
```java
package com.telusko.app;

import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component // Marks Alien as a Spring-managed bean
public class Alien {
    @Autowired // Injects the Laptop dependency
    private Laptop laptop;

    public void code() {
        laptop.compile();
    }
}
```
- `@Autowired` automatically injects an instance of `Laptop` from the Spring container.
- Instead of manually creating a `Laptop` object, Spring manages it.

---

## **Step 3: Modify the `App` Class**
```java
package com.telusko.app;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext;

@SpringBootApplication
public class App {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ApplicationContext context = SpringApplication.run(App.class, args);

        Alien obj = context.getBean(Alien.class);
        obj.code();
    }
}
```
- The `ApplicationContext` manages all beans.
- `context.getBean(Alien.class)` fetches an instance of `Alien`, which internally gets a `Laptop` object injected.
- Running the application prints:
  ```
  Compiling
  ```
  This confirms successful **multi-layered dependency injection**.

---

## **Key Takeaways**
- **`@Component`** marks a class as a Spring bean.
- **`@Autowired`** injects dependencies automatically.
- Spring Boot manages the entire object creation process using the **ApplicationContext**.
- This approach allows **better maintainability** and **loose coupling**.

**Next Steps:**
Try adding another layer by creating a `CPU` class and injecting it into `Laptop` using `@Autowired`.
